Lastfm-Lookup
=============

*Alfred 3 workflow to retrieve similar artist info*

Search Last.fm database for an artist and retrieve a list of suggested artists. Selecting the similar artist from Alfred's list takes you to the Last.fm page for more info.

*I highly recommend downloading this from Packal as they provide an updating feature for future versions of the workflow.

- "LS" or Hotkey triggers the workflow.
- Initially populates with a search for the currently playing track in iTunes, if one is playing.
- As you type an artist name, the workflow searches Last.fm for your query and provides a list of possible matches.
- Selecting an artist form the list provides a new list of Last.fm's Similar Artists for the previously chosen one.
- Selecting an artist from the new list takes you to their Last.fm page.
