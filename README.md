Lastfm-Lookup
=============

*Alfred 2 workflow to retrieve similar artist info*

Search Last.fm database for an artist and retrieve a list of suggested artists. Selecting the similar artist from Alfred's list takes you to the Last.fm page for more info.

- "LS" or Hotkey triggers the workflow.
- Initially populates with a search for the currently playing track in iTunes, if one is playing.
- As you type an artist name, the workflow searches Last.fm for your query and provides a list of possible matches.

- Selecting an artist from the new list takes you to their Last.fm page.
